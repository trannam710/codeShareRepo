written notice if a film is a reduced income negative pick-
up.

8.2.2
distribution expenses:  distributor shall
(i) be responsible for all direct distribution expenses in
connection with the exercise of the distribution license
rights to such film (the ""distribution expenses""), and
(ii) for the purpose of determining the licensor’s share, be
entitled to deduct such expenses from any gross receipts
remaining after deduction of the applicable distribution fee,
all distribution expenses which it paid (net of any discounts,
credits, refunds, allowances, rebates and/or similar items
provided
to
distributor
by
third
parties
and
which
distribution expenses shall not include internal charges or
overhead), provided that such distribution expenses are
approved by licensor in writing prior to distributor's
incurring any obligation regarding any such expense.  any
distribution expenses incurred and/or paid by distributor
which have not been pre-approved in writing by licensor shall
not be deducted from gross receipts for the purpose of
calculating licensor’s share.  for the avoidance of doubt,
upon licensor’s request, distributor shall disclose all
discounts, credits, refunds, allowances rebates and comparable
items provided to distributor by third parties in order to
enable licensor to validate the proper calculation of
distribution expenses.  licensor shall have the right to
designate and/or approve all persons providing goods and/or


services whose costs are a distribution expense of the film(s).
distribution expenses shall include, without limitation, the
following:

(a)
costs and laboratory charges for feature
prints and trailers (35mm, hard drive, digital (2d or 3d) as
applicable), translations, subtitling, dubbing, film cans
(where applicable), reels (where applicable), containers and
storage, including, without limitation, digital fees, but
excluding any such materials provided to distributor free of
charge hereunder. the term “digital fees” shall mean all costs
and charges relating to digital prints, including, without
limitation, digital conversion fees also known as virtual
print fees, and costs and charges associated with dcps and
kdms, and costs and royalties related to digital release audio
and visual formats, but excluding any such materials provided
to distributor free of charge hereunder.

(b)
backroom expenses contracted from third
parties attributable to such film.

(c)
insurance charges and inter-territorial
and intra-territorial shipping and freight charges.

(d)
licensor's allocable share of local film
board dues and expenses and related industry assessments
(which share shall be based on film rentals) as determined by
distributor in good faith.

(e)
duties, customs fees, cost of import
licenses calculated and paid in accordance with the provisions
of paragraph 9.4 below, as well as censorship charges,
copyright charges and checking, screening and release fees
provided all such amounts are incurred and paid to third
parties in the ordinary and customary course.

(f)
reasonable outside attorneys' fees and
litigation expenses directly related to the distribution or
exploitation of such film, subject to licensor's prior written
approval.

(g)
advertising, promotion, publicity and
accessories costs (subject to the definition of gross receipts
in paragraph 38 hereof), excluding any advertising materials
provided to distributor free of charge hereunder.

(h)
any local taxes based on film rentals,
film hire turnover or distribution expenses such as sales,


use, excise and value added taxes which, in the normal course
of business, are not recoverable by distributor either from
customers, or by credit or otherwise.

notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this
agreement, it is expressly understood that no net income,
franchise, corporation, excess profits or similar tax shall be
an allowed distribution expense.

(i)
the direct costs of conversion of monies
(excluding exchange rate fluctuations), including cable
expenses and any discounts taken for the conversion thereof,
into u.s. dollars (or such other currency as may be designated
by licensor), which are charged apart from and not incorporated
into the exchange rate, and all costs of transmission of such
monies to licensor in the u.s.

8.3
cross-collateralization:  for each film in the
territory,
distributor
shall
be
entitled
to
cross-
collateralize the unrecouped amounts in the order of priority
and only to the extent set forth below, based upon financial
data determined, recorded and computed as of the end of the
particular statement period for which an accounting statement
is being rendered:



8.3.1  as between films in the territory:  with
respect to each film in the territory, distributor shall be
entitled to cross-collateralize the unrecouped amounts against
remaining gross receipts derived from the distribution of all
other films in the territory.



8.3.2  unrecouped amounts:  if distributor does not
recoup all unrecouped amounts after performing the cross-
collateralization computations noted in paragraph 8.3.1 above,
distributor shall not be entitled to invoice licensor for any
such remaining unrecouped amounts and such unrecouped amounts
shall be solely for the account of distributor.

8.4
fees to subdistributors:  any and all fees and
commissions paid to licensor-approved subdistributors shall be
paid by distributor at its sole cost and expense and shall not
be deductible or recoupable as a distribution expense, nor
shall distributor be entitled to invoice licensor for such
fees or commissions.

8.5
taxes:  if, in accordance with any applicable laws,
any income tax withholding (other than distributor income
taxes) is imposed by any governmental authority in the


territory on any amount required to be remitted by distributor
to licensor hereunder, distributor shall deduct (or cause the
deduction of) the amount of such tax from licensor’s share and
pay (or cause the payment of) such tax to the applicable tax
authorities for the account of licensor, unless otherwise
instructed by licensor in writing.  distributor shall provide
to licensor, within thirty (30) days after the date of such
tax payment, an official receipt, voucher or other official
government document which evidences the receipt of the tax
payment by the relevant tax authorities.  the receipt, voucher
or official government document shall (i) indicate the amount
of such taxes paid or deducted on behalf of licensor and the
date(s) on which such taxes were paid or deducted, and (ii) be
in licensor’s name or shall indicate licensor’s liability
therefor sufficient to support a tax credit in the u.s. or in
such other applicable country designated by licensor (in each
case, the “tax credit country”); and (iii) include, as
supporting documentation, (1) a translation of each non-
english document into english and (2) a reconciliation of the
tax payments actually made against the entries corresponding
to such tax payments on the applicable accounting statements.
for the avoidance of doubt, if the applicable receipt, voucher
or government document is not properly provided on a timely
basis and/or the applicable supporting documentation (e.g.,
translation, reconciliation, etc.) is not provided within
ninety (90) days after the date on which the taxes were
purportedly paid or deducted, the applicable withholding or
other similar tax will not be allowed as a deduction (and
distributor shall not be allowed to deduct the amount of such
withholding or other similar tax from licensor’s share) and,
accordingly distributor shall promptly pay to licensor an
amount equal to the amount of the applicable withholding or
other similar tax.  distributor shall not claim any foreign
tax credit in the tax credit country on any such tax paid in
accordance with any applicable law on behalf of or in the name
of licensor or with respect to any monies due to licensor by
distributor.  distributor shall use commercially reasonable
efforts to minimize any applicable withholding taxes,
including, but not limited to, (i) giving effect to any
applicable tax treaties, (ii) furnishing to licensor the
applicable forms for licensor to claim the tax exemption or
tax reduction, and (iii) promptly upon licensor’s return of
such forms to distributor, filing such forms on behalf of
licensor with the applicable authorities, as may be required
under the applicable tax law.
