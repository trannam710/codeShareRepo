the disclosing Party would regard as confidential.
20.3
Confidential Information shall exclude information which:
20.3.1 at the time of receipt by the receiving Party is in the public domain;
20.3.2 subsequently comes into the public domain through no fault of the receiving Party or its

20.3.3 is lawfully received by the receiving Party from a third party on an unrestricted basis; and/or
20.3.4 can be demonstrated to have already been known to the receiving Party before receipt

20.4
Each Party undertakes to maintain the confidentiality of the other Party’s Confidential Information
at all times and to use no less adequate measures than it uses in respect of its own Confidential
Information to keep the other Party’s Confidential Information reasonably secure. Without limiting
the generality of the foregoing, each Party shall institute, implement and maintain at all times during

misuse, or modification of the other Party’s Confidential Information (including consumer data and

advance notice (if legally permissible) of the intended disclosure and a reasonable opportunity to
challenge the same.

Neither Party will be held criminally or civilly liable under any federal or state trade secret law for
the disclosure of the other Party’s Confidential Information related to such Party’s trade secrets that

Indemnification; Limitation of Liability23
23.1
Agency shall defend Advertiser Indemnitees from and against any and all Claims which any of them
may suffer, incur, or which may be asserted against any of them, in whole or in part, to the extent
by reason of, or to the extent in connection with, the following:
23.1.1 any alleged or actual breach by Agency of this Agreement, including its representations,
warranties, covenants and obligations set forth in this Agreement;
23.1.2 acts by Agency, or any Agency Group member of negligence or willful misconduct;
23.1.3 any death, injury to Person or damage to property in connection with the Services caused
by the acts or omissions of Agency or any Agency Group member;
23.1.4 any alleged or actual breach by Agency or Agency Group members of Section 32 (Data
Protection and Security);
23.1.5 any alleged or actual violation by Agency or any Agency Group member of any Applicable
Laws; or
23.1.6 any claims from Agency Subcontractors for payment or claims by such Subcontractors or
any Vendor that they are employees of any Advertiser Indemnitee (23.1.1 - 23.1.6,
collectively, “Advertiser Claims”).
Agency shall further indemnify and hold harmless Advertiser Indemnitees from any and all Losses
incurred by Advertiser Indemnitees in connection with such Advertiser Claims.
23.2
Advertiser shall defend Agency Indemnitees from and against any and all Claims which any of them
may suffer or incur, or which may be asserted against any of them in whole or in part, to the extent
by reason of, or to the extent in connection with, the following:
23.2.1 Advertiser Materials, including the inaccuracy, incompleteness or impropriety of

Advertiser shall further indemnify and hold harmless Agency Indemnitees from any and all Losses
incurred by Agency Indemnitees in connection with such Agency Claims.
23Other than Section 23.5, the Template does not include Limitation of Liability caps or super caps. Every Advertiser has different
leverage in its negotiations and many Advertisers have a standard practice of not including caps in their agreements with suppliers.
However, as with many other contracts, it is common practice for parties to agree to caps and super caps. For example, higher caps
on liability for certain categories of breaches of obligations, most notably in relation to breaches of data privacy provisions and
obligations, including those set forth in the Advertiser’s data processing agreement.

the prior written consent of the Indemnified Party, which shall not be unreasonably
withheld;
23.3.4 the Indemnified Party must provide the Indemnifying Party with all available information
and assistance in relation to such Claim as the Indemnifying Party may reasonably require
at the Indemnifying Party’s cost and expense; and
23.3.5 Notwithstanding Section 23.3.3 above, if within ninety (90) days after the Indemnifying

approval before incorporating third party materials into Deliverables and shall inform Advertiser in
writing if Advertiser’s ownership of Deliverables shall be limited in any way by the rights of third
parties.
25.4
Agency agrees, at Advertiser’s request and expense, to take all such actions and execute all such
documents as are necessary (in Advertiser’s reasonable opinion) to enable Advertiser to obtain,
defend or enforce its rights in the Deliverables, and shall not do or fail to do any act which would or

irrevocably agrees that all claims in respect of such dispute or any suit, action, or proceeding related
thereto may be heard and determined in such courts. The Parties irrevocably waive, to the fullest
extent permitted by Applicable Law, any objection which they may now or hereafter have to the
laying of venue of any such dispute brought in such court or any defense of inconvenient forum for
the maintenance of such dispute. Each of the Parties hereto agrees that a judgment in any such
dispute may be enforced in other jurisdictions by suit on the judgment or in any other manner

deductible under the insurance required by this Agreement. To the extent that Agency maintains insurance
greater than the minimum requirements set forth above, Agency agrees that such insurance shall be
applicable to any of Agency’s obligations under the Agreement. In specifying minimum insurance
requirements in this Agreement, Advertiser does not assert or recommend this insurance is adequate to
Agency’s requirements. Agency is solely responsible to inform itself of the types or amounts of insurance it
may need beyond these requirements to protect itself from liability or loss.

Agreement.

advertiser.
2.2

by advertiser. the parties shall agree to the completed version of the exit plan within [one hundred
twenty (120) days] of the effective date.

principles, and agency shall incorporate all reasonable amendments requested by advertiser.

such services as advertiser may reasonably require consistent with the exit principles and the last
approved version of the exit plan in good faith to advertiser.
4.8
agency shall ensure that the exit plan constitutes a detailed plan of the tasks and responsibilities
of the parties required to enable the transfer of the advertiser data, advertiser materials and
services, which shall no longer be provided by agency to the replacement supplier.

(a)
a reasonable set of procedures and arrangements for the transfer of the provision of the

business of advertiser as a result of the exit from or expiration of this agreement; and

The party suffering such event of Force Majeure shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to remedy the same as soon as possible. The term “Force Majeure,” as used in this Agreement, shall mean any events or occurrences that are not within the reasonable control of the party claiming suspension and which, by the exercise of due diligence, such party could not have prevented or is unable to overcome; provided, however, that neither economic hardship nor improper maintenance shall constitute Force Majeure.
